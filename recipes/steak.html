    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The reverse sear method ensures a tender, juicy steak with a flavorful crust by starting with a low-temperature roast in the oven. Begin by roasting your steak at 225째F until it reaches an internal temperature of about 125째F for medium-rare, allowing it to cook slowly and evenly, similar to sous vide. Once it reaches the desired internal temperature, sear the steak in a hot pan with a neutral oil such as canola, vegetable, or grapeseed to develop a nice crust.</p>
    <p>After searing, reduce the heat and add butter, along with hardy herbs or crushed garlic cloves for flavor. Tilt the pan to pool the melted butter and aromatics, then spoon the mixture over the steak to enhance the flavor and crispiness. Finally, let the steak rest on a cutting board for at least 10 minutes to allow the juices to redistribute and ensure tenderness. Slice against the grain and season with flaky sea salt for a perfect finishing touch.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1</strong> 2"-thick rib eye steak (about 14 oz.)</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Canola oil</li>
        <li><strong>2 Tbsp.</strong> butter</li>
        <li><strong>3</strong> cloves of garlic, crushed</li>
        <li><strong>2</strong> sprigs rosemary</li>
        <li>Flaky sea salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 225째. Season steak generously with salt and pepper. Transfer steak to a wire rack set in a sheet tray and roast for 50 to 55 minutes, until internal temperature of steak is 125째 for medium rare. (If you prefer a more well done steak, adjust timing as necessary for temperature.)</li>
        <li>In a medium cast iron skillet over medium-high, heat oil until almost smoking. Add steak and cook, flipping once, until a deep golden crust begins to form on both sides of the steak, about 1 minute per side.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium low and add butter, garlic, and rosemary to the pan. Using a kitchen towel, carefully grip the skillet handle and tilt towards you so that the melting butter forms a pool at the bottom of the skillet. Using a spoon, continually baste butter onto steak to form a deeper golden crust. Make sure that the rosemary and garlic are submerged in the butter; this will help their flavors meld together. If the steak has any excess fat around the sides, use tongs to hold up the steak on its side and render out the fat.</li>
        <li>Transfer steak onto a cutting board and let rest about 10 minutes to lock in the juices.</li>
        <li>Slice on a bias against the grain, sprinkle with flaky salt and more pepper.</li>
    </ol>
