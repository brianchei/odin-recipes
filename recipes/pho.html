    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Pho</strong>, a beloved Vietnamese soup, is traditionally a clear beef broth filled with rice noodles, topped with various meats, and garnished with fresh herbs. The broth's depth of flavor comes from charred aromatics such as onions, ginger, cinnamon, and star anise, alongside spices and fish sauce. Historically made with beef bones, a <em>cost-effective</em> and flavorful alternative is using cuts of meat with connective tissue and fat, like rib finger meat. This broth, sweetened with rock sugar and seasoned to an umami-rich perfection, is balanced by the blandness of noodles and the brightness of lime.</p>
    <p>To prepare pho, char the aromatics using a blowtorch, gas range, or oven. For stovetop cooking, parboil the meat, then simmer it with the aromatics and spices for 4-6 hours. Alternatively, use an Instant Pot for quicker results. Serve the broth over medium-thickness rice noodles that have been briefly blanched and dried. Add thinly sliced sirloin, meatballs, brisket, and optional tripe or tendon for texture. Top with fresh onions, cilantro, Thai basil, bean sprouts, chilies, and lime. Enhance the flavor with sriracha and hoisin sauce. Enjoy pho in a large, warmed bowl to fully appreciate its aromatic and flavorful complexity.</p>

    </ul>
    
    <h3>For the pho soup</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs beef for soup see notes</li>
        <li>3 inch daikon 1" slices, optional</li>
        <li>4 qt water</li>
        <li>2 oz rock sugar ~1/4 cup white sugar, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fish sauce or to taste</li>
        <li>24 oz dried pho noodles or fresh, see notes</li>
        <li>8 Vietnamese meatballs or more, <strong>cut in halves</strong></li>
        <li>1 lb sirloin roast <strong>thinly sliced</strong></li>
        <li>1 lb brisket or flank steak</li>
        <li>1/2 lb tendon optional</li>
        <li>1/2 lb omasum optional</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>To serve the pho</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh cilantro <strong>roughly chopped</strong></li>
        <li>1/2 medium onion <strong>sliced</strong></li>        
        <li>3 cups bean sprouts blanched if desired</li>
        <li>1 lime <strong>cut</strong> into wedges</li>
        <li>1 bunch Thai basil</li>
        <li>1 jalapeño sliced</li>
        <li>sriracha</li>
        <li>hoisin sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Arrange the larger aromatics on a heat proof baking sheet and blow torch until fragrant. Alternately, toast all aromatics in a cast iron pan on the stove or in the oven broiler for a few minutes until fragrant.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>To make the pho soup</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Transfer charred aromatics along with sugar and all meats except the sirloin to Instant Pot/Pressure cooker. Fill to the max fill line with water, about 4 quarts. Set pressure to high and cook time to 35 minutes and cook. Quick release the pressure when cooking time is completed. See notes for stovetop instructions.</li>
        <li>Once cool enough to taste, add fish sauce 1 tablespoon at a time until it’s just about overseasoned. Add extra sugar if needed. If you go too far, just add water. You may optionally strain the pho at this point to get as clear of a broth as possible.</li>        
    </ol>
    
    <h3>To serve</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Warm your bowls with hot tap water, then drain. Bring a pot of water to a boil and briefly blanch the noodles, then rinse with cold water and drain well. Divide noodles evenly into each of the warmed bowls. Thinly slice the sirloin (if needed) and top each bowl. Thickly chop all the other meats and divide evenly.</li>
        <li>Cover with about 2 cups of hot broth per bowl and sprinkle chopped cilantro and sliced onions over top. Serve with a plate of bean sprouts, limes, Thai basil, and chilies. Have small dipping plates of sriracha and hoisin sauces for each person.</li>
