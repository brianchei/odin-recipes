    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Birria tacos, known for their rich red-stained appearance, have become a popular dish on social media and at Mexican eateries. “Birria” refers to the meat inside the tacos, traditionally a goat meat stew from Jalisco, Mexico, now often made with beef. The beef is braised for hours with dried chiles, garlic, and spices, creating a flavorful consomé and tender meat. For an authentic at-home recipe, José Moreno of Birria-Landia suggests using beef bones and marrow, particularly beef shank or short ribs, complemented with cuts like top round or brisket for extra meatiness.</p>
    <p>Key to the dish's flavor are dried chiles, especially guajillos, which provide an earthy, sweet backbone without making the birria too spicy. José adds moritas for a smoky, mildly spicy complexity. The beef is braised low and slow for 4-5 hours to tenderize the meat and extract flavors from the bones. Birria can be served in various forms, but a popular choice is quesatacos, where tortillas are seared with birria fat, filled with melty queso oaxaca, and served with consomé for dipping. The joy of birria lies in dunking these flavorful tacos into the rich, aromatic broth.</p>

        <li><strong>2 Tbsp.</strong> vegetable oil</li>
        <li><strong>3</strong> Roma tomatoes, halved crosswise</li>
        <li><strong>6</strong> cloves garlic</li>
        <li><strong>10</strong> whole cloves</li>
        <li><strong>1</strong> (3") cinnamon stick</li>
        <li><strong>1/4 c.</strong> white wine vinegar</li>
        <li><strong>1 1/2 tsp.</strong> cumin seeds</li>
        <li><strong>1 tsp.</strong> dried oregano</li>
        <li><strong>1</strong> large yellow onion, quartered</li>
        <li><strong>5</strong> bay leaves</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Assembly</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6" corn tortillas</li>
        <li>Shredded Oaxaca or mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Chopped white onion</li>
        <li>Chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>Lime wedges</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Birria</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350º. In a large, heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium heat, toast guajillo, morita, and pasilla chiles, stirring frequently, until softened and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer chiles to a medium heatproof bowl, then cover with boiling water. Using a small plate or bowl, completely submerge chiles. Let soak until rehydrated and pliable, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, generously season brisket and oxtails with salt and pepper. In same pot over medium-high heat, heat oil. Working in batches, cook beef, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, 6 to 7 minutes per side for brisket/roast, 4 to 5 minutes for bone-in parts. Transfer to a plate or cutting board.</li>
        <li>In a blender, blend chiles, 1 1/2 cups chile liquid, tomatoes, garlic, cloves, cinnamon, vinegar, cumin, and oregano, adding more chile liquid if needed, until a pourable paste forms, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Return beef to pot and add onion, bay leaves, and chile paste. Pour in enough water to just cover beef; season with a heavy pinch of salt. Bring to a simmer over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat, cover, and bake until beef is fork-tender, 4 to 4 1/2 hours. Discard bay leaves and onion, transfer beef to a cutting board, and reserve broth (or consomé). Shred beef with 2 forks.</li>
        <li>Taste consomé; season with salt and pepper. Depending on your preference, to thin out consomé, add water or chicken or beef stock until desired consistency is reached.</li>
        <li>Make Ahead: Birria can be made 5 days ahead. Store beef and consomé in separate airtight containers and refrigerate.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Assembly</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In same large pot over medium-low heat, bring consomé to a bare simmer (there should be a layer of dark red-looking fat/oil on top).</li>
        <li>Construct a taco station: Have the consomé simmering on one burner, a large cast-iron skillet or plancha heated over medium heat on another, a plate of shredded beef from the birria and another plate of tortillas to the side, as well as small bowls filled with Oaxaca cheese, onions, and cilantro.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, reheat 1/3 cup beef on one side of cast-iron skillet, leaving enough room for a tortilla, tossing occasionally, until seared and browned. Take a tortilla and dip into consomé, coating both sides with dark red fat. Place tortilla on cast-iron skillet next to beef and cover with cheese.</li>
        <li>Fry tortilla until cheese is mostly melted and underside has browned and started to crisp, about 3 minutes. Place seared meat on one half of tortilla and top with onion and cilantro. Fold tortilla into a taco and cook until crisp, about 30 seconds per side. Repeat with remaining beef.</li>
        <li>Serve tacos with lime wedges and small bowls of consomé for dipping alongside.</li>
    </ol>
